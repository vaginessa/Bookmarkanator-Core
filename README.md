# Bookmarkanator
A cross platform bookmarking tool inspired by the OwnCloud bookmarks addon. 

In the OwnCloud bookmarks addon, one could create web bookmarks, tag them and search them.
When a tag was selected, only bookmarks with that tag would be shown. If additional tags were
selected only bookmarks with all those tags were shown. This enabled one to find a specific
bookmark out of hundreds very quickly.

The Bookmarkanator program operates in a similar fashion but with the following differences:

1. I allows one to bookmark files, folders, text notes, as well as websites. For instance
you could take notes that can be tagged, and searched easily. You could store many hundreds 
of files that you use frequently and tag and label them for easy searching.

2. It has powerful tag selection panels that allow the user to filter down the list of bookmarks 
to exactly what they want to see. For example you could select select some tags, which would 
show the bookmarks that have those tags. Lets suppose that the list of bookmarks is still pretty large.
You could then add another tag selection panel, and configure it to exclude bookmarks with certain
tags, which would further narrow the results.

3. It allows more tech savvy users to create their own types of bookmarks, or load ones created by others.
These "bookmarks" are actually small programs that are integrated into the search and tagging of the main
program as well as having their data automatically saved and loaded. Bookmarks can communicate with 
each other, as well as operate on other bookmarks. For example one could create a group of social media 
bookmarks, drop them all in a directory that has a copy of the Bookmarkanator program. Those bookmarks 
could talk to each other, download feeds, etc. When the program starts up it will have all those types
of bookmarks available to it. You could then create a completely unrelated set of bookmarks, put them 
in another directory with another Bookmarkanator program, and use them in isolation to the social 
media bookmarks.

4. It is an independent cross platform bookmarking tool, not an addon to another tool.

One question that comes to peoples minds is why have a separate bookmarking tool when there 
are so many great tools already out there? There are bookmark managers for browsers that 
synchronize bookmarks across devices. We have tagging and searching of files in some
operating systems. There exists many awesome note taking tools, with features galore.
In addition to these specialized tools we could always put our information in documents,
or spreadsheets, or organize things in folders.

The answer is that this program provides a single uncomplicated interface to 
add the most important functionality of many of the previously mentioned tools.
It is a tool for power users that are interested in quickly locating, and using
related information gathered over time. It's a way to organize and associate 
information in a searchable sortable interface.

It also helps with frequent context switching. If you tend to work on a project for a few
hours to a few days before switching to another project, and repeating the process. This 
tool is perfect for you. You could take notes, bookmark websites, reference images, word 
documents, or other files/folders. The next time that project comes up it will be easy 
to locate that information again.
